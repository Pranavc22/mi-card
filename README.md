# Mi Card

## Introduction
Mi Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time you wanted to give someone your contact details or your business card but you didn't have it on you. Well, now you can get them to download your business card as an app.
This app is one step further from my previous app. Mi Card focuses more on the UI aspect of an app and teaches a few new things. 

## Concepts involved
Once again, the app structure is simple. However, we have used some new widgets and done a lot of styling for each of them.
Some of the new concepts learned are:  
- Creating Stateless Widgets
- Using Hot Reload and Hot Restart
- Containers (UI Layout)
- Columns and Rows (UI Layout)
- Adding custom fonts from Google Fonts.
- Adding Material icons.
- Styling Text widgets even more.
